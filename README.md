Describtion:

Project: Food Delivery App UI Kit

A Figma UI Kit & prototype for a food delivery mobile app. The design is intended as a toolkit of reusable components, screens, and flows that could power a full food / restaurant ordering experience, with a focus on clarity, usability, and visual appeal.

Key Features / Components

Onboarding / Authentication Screens
Includes screens for signup, login, password reset, user onboarding. These help new users get started.

Restaurant & Food Browsing
Screens to browse restaurants, view food categories, filter by type, search, and see featured / promoted meals.

Restaurant / Menu Detail View
When selecting a restaurant or a menu item: full details (images, description, price, ratings, availability), along with options (e.g. size, extras, variants).

Cart / Checkout Flow
A flow for adding items to cart, reviewing order, selecting payment, and placing an order. Clear displays of cost, fees, delivery info.

Order Tracking
Status updates on orders: e.g. order accepted, being prepared, out for delivery. Possibly map / driver tracking if included.

User Profile & Settings
For managing user info, address, saved favourites, payment methods, notifications.

Notifications / Offers / Promotions
Screens for promos (discounts, deals), push notifications, maybe special offers featured.

Reusable Components & Design System
The UI Kit includes buttons, cards, icons, input fields, typography styles, colour styles, maybe forms etc., all organized for reuse.

Visual / UI / UX Style

Clean, modern look with strong visual hierarchy: large food images, clear typography for readability.

Consistent layout grid, spacing, alignment to make UI look polished.

Use of colour, icons, imagery to make navigation intuitive and appetite appealing.

Attention to usability: making it easy to find what you want (search, filter), clear feedback (cart, order status), intuitive interactions.

Purpose & Goals

To provide a comprehensive UI kit that can accelerate design of a food delivery app â€” useful for designers, developers, teams wanting to build or prototype such product.

To demonstrate ability to design multi-screen flows that cover the full user journey: from browsing to ordering, tracking, and post-purchase.

To showcase clean, usable UI design, component reusability, and good visual design principles.
